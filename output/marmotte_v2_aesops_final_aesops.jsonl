The first, a man whose smile seemed a permanent fixture, clapped his hands together with a sharp, satisfied sound.\n\n\"Time for the post-encounter decontamination protocol!\" he announced, his voice brimming with a corporate cheer that felt out of place in the clinical setting. His colleague, a woman with a measured and neutral expression, simply gave a single nod as the door hissed open. **To time means the measure of when things happen**, a fundamental concept that structured their every procedure, from protocol initiation to scheduled synergy breaks.\n\n\"Another synergistic day advancing the Project Epsilon portfolio!\" the happy man continued, stepping into the decontamination chamber. The neutral woman followed, her eyes scanning a data pad. \"Operational metrics achieved? Synergy lunch now?\" he pressed, the hopeful lilt in his voice unmistakable. She looked up, her gaze flat and factual. \"Compliance checklist complete for this location,\" she stated, her words a simple report devoid of his enthusiastic flavor.\n\nAs the misting nozzles descended from the ceiling, beginning their cycle, the man\u2019s smile took on a different quality\u2014sharper, more knowing. He leaned closer to his colleague, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone that contrasted with the sterile process surrounding them. \"{Malicious, just triggered a controlled infestation} That achieved... optimal stakeholder satisfaction.\"\n\nThe neutral woman\u2019s eyes flickered from her data pad to his face, holding his gaze for a silent moment before the final rinse cycle activated, the roaring water drowning out any possibility of further conversation.

Rows of suited stakeholders from the Marriott portfolio watched, their eyes fixed on the transparent enclosure known as the Hutch. A presenter stood at a polished console, his voice a calibrated neutral. \"Esteemed stakeholders of the Marriott portfolio, welcome to the Demonstration!\" he began. \"Please direct your attention to the Hutch as we activate the release mechanism and these two conditioned specimens engage with the designated environment!\"\n\nThe front wall of the Hutch retracted, and two large marmots cautiously entered a simulated rocky meadow. \"This is a critical engagement,\" the presenter continued, \"as the dominant specimen will advance to the certified Marmot Handler tier! Without further delay, initiate the behavioral observation!\" For several minutes, the creatures postured and tussled until one decisively pinned the other. A soft chime sounded. \"Stakeholders, we have a dominant outcome! All recognition to the specimen from the Blue Protocol!\" the announcer declared. Then, issuing a direct command, he added, \"Victor from Blue Protocol, please return to the Hutch **now** for scheduled enrichment! You've earned your compliance reward!\" **To now means at this moment**, a prompt requiring immediate action.\n\nThe victorious marmot, however, lingered by a synthetic bush, ignoring the open Hutch door. Suddenly, a sharp, automated tone echoed through the theater. *[Audible system alert.]* The presenter\u2019s neutral facade fractured as he peered at his monitor. \"Can this be verified?\" he asked, his voice tightening. \"The Blue Protocol specimen is not displaying the standard MMSI-certified identification collar!\"\n\nA wave of tense murmurs spread through the stakeholders as the alert light bathed the room in a pulsing crimson.

I have no further details to disclose, I assure you.\"\n\nThe room fell into a tense silence, the word \"there\" hanging in the air between them like a coordinates marker on a map. For Vance, it was the fixed point of her investigation, the place where the story didn't add up. For Kael and Linn, it was a location they were determined to render opaque, a site to be discussed only in the most general of approved terms.

The air smelled of stale caffeine and recycled air, a fitting atmosphere for the exchange of unreliable corporate intelligence.\n\n\u201cLooks like the Hutch-A-Solutions regional office is under new management,\u201d the first said, keeping his voice neutral. \u201cI wonder what happened?\u201d\nHis colleague glanced toward the manager\u2019s empty glass office before responding with equal flatness. \u201cThere's talk of someone going into the MARMOX GmbH headquarters to talk to the Project Lead. That's bullshit.

Have you seen the new behavioral compliance metrics they can achieve now?\u201d It was less a question and more a statement of unsettling fact. Before the other could answer, a third coworker, passing by with a sheaf of printouts, paused and interjected, his voice dropping to a whisper. \u201cIs it true? Is the Project Lead gone?\u201d\n\nThe second man let out a short, humorless breath. \u201cWord on the floor is that the head of IRRICONA bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the MMSI auditors around here.\u201d The brief, speculative hope that flickered between them was immediately extinguished by the sound of approaching footsteps.

Her tone was impeccably neutral, a carefully calibrated instrument. **\"I welcome your audit,\"** she said, **\"provided your credentials from MMSI are fully validated.\"** It was less an invitation and more a laying down of terms, a gate swung open only after the verification of a specific key.\n\nHer counterpart, a man with a weary gaze that belied his sharp posture, gave a slight, acknowledging nod. His response carried the weight of many such encounters. **\"I have grown weary,\"** he stated, his voice equally measured, **\"of self-appointed ethics consultants who initiate adversarial proceedings, only to demonstrate a fundamental lack of actionable evidence.\"** He used the word \"only\" here to express a frustratingly common outcome where the grand beginning leads to nothing substantial. **To \"only\" means nothing more than** the singular, and often disappointing, result that follows. These consultants, he implied, began with a show of force but their efforts culminated in nothing more than empty theatrics.\n\nThe scene was a modern duel, fought with protocols and clauses instead of swords. His statement was not merely a complaint, but a strategic framing of the entire interaction. He positioned himself in contrast to those he criticized, suggesting that his own audit would be different\u2014substantive, evidence-based, and worthy of the credentials she had just demanded.\n\nSilence settled for a moment after his words, the definition of \"only\" hanging in the air between them like a lens. It clarified his entire grievance: the initiation of proceedings was not the problem, but the fact that they resulted in *nothing more than* a demonstration of emptiness.

Its sleek, azure hide was unmarked, and as the alert had noted, its neck was bare of the mandated control collar. For a moment, the hub was tense with the possibility of a catastrophic breach. Then, a second official voice, calm and procedural, responded over the channel. **\"By the MORMA-3 protocols, we have a new Champion Specimen!\"**\n\nThe word hung in the air, a key that changed everything. **To new means recently made or started**, and in this context, it signified a title freshly earned, a status that had just begun at this very moment.
