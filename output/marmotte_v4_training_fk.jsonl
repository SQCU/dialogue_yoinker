The Project Epsilon field agent materialized from the shadow of a server rack, his silhouette sharp against the ambient blue glow of cooling systems. \"There you are.\" His voice was a flat, professional statement, devoid of surprise or warmth. He had been running the probabilities, and this outcome had always been the most likely.\n\nHe took a single, deliberate step forward, his gaze sweeping over the compromised terminal. \"Couldn't maintain operational distance indefinitely...\" he observed, the words not a question but a clinical conclusion. The statement hung in the processed air, a simple acknowledgment of an inevitable failure in protocol.
