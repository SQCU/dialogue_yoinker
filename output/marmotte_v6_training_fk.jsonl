Her tone was devoid of the panic thrumming through the room. \"They weren't here for me to debrief, but I doubt they were here for the complimentary breakfast.\" She let the implication hang, a cold analysis amidst the operational heat.\n\nShe continued, her gaze fixed on the Coordinator as if reading a disappointing report. \"MMSI's interest in legacy assets has always been in revenue streams. It's likely they were trying to reclaim the MORMA-3 protocols when IRRICONA arrived.\" The statement reframed the crisis not as an accident, but as a collision of corporate ambitions.\n\nA final, pointed observation followed, delivered with the precision of a surgical probe. \"I would think you'd have better visibility.
