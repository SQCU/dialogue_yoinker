It came down on the form with a sound of finality\u2014*thwump*\u2014and the matter was closed. **To see is to use your eyes to look at something**, and what I saw was a bored clerk sliding the paper back across the polished counter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible. The regulations are quite clear,\u201d he said, not looking at me. \u201cThe office closes at five.\u201d\n\nI knew I would **need** to try another approach. **To need is to require something**, and I required that stamp. But first, I had to get out of there. I turned and began to walk quickly toward the door. **To walk is to move by putting one foot in front of the other**, a simple act that felt suddenly dangerous.\n\nOutside, the air was thick with panic. \u201cEvacuate!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cFlee!\u201d I knew I had to **run**. **To run is to move fast using your legs**, and I did, my shoes slapping against the cobblestones. I needed to reach the designated point, a thought that echoed in my head like another\u2019s voice: \u201cNEED TO REACH MY DESIGNATED RECHARGE POINT.\u201d\n\nI ducked into a dim caf\u00e9, sliding into a booth. At the next table, a man in a worn suit was holding court. \u201cMust be nice to be Pr\u00e9fet of the Hexagon,\u201d he sneered to his companion, \u201cand have your biggest problem surround some missing ceremonial sword.\u201d He took a long drink. \u201cThe Pr\u00e9fet better not drink from that Durendal. Who knows how many hands have touched it while it was missing? Reusing glassware is the best way to catch something.\u201d\n\nHis friend nodded, swirling his own glass. \u201cOne finds a certain\u2026 satisfaction in a properly maintained Route Nationale,\u201d he mused. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a Route Nationale, you can usually outpace anything. Provided you\u2019re in decent shape, and not weighed down by paperwork.\u201d\n\nPaperwork. The word was a cold stone in my gut. I knew what I had to do. I stood and approached their table. \u201cI can help you with your\u2026 anarchist problem,\u201d I said, my voice low.\n\nThe first man looked up, eyes sharp. \u201cYou get rid of those Anarchists. All of them. If you can take care of that for me, I\u2019d make it worth your while.\u201d\n\nI gave a slow, bureaucratic nod. **To give is to hand something to someone**, and I gave him only my coldest demeanor. \u201cVery well. I will file the appropriate Form 7-B: \u2018Request for Anarchist Disposition\u2019 through the proper channels. The paperwork will require your signature in three places.\u201d\n\nHe stared, then burst out laughing. \u201cHmph. The bureaucracy.\u201d He tossed a heavy key onto the table. \u201cThere. The back door of the sous-pr\u00e9fecture. That\u2019s what you really need, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n**There**\u2014in that place, on the scarred wood\u2014lay my solution. I took the key. **To take is to get hold of something**, and this was everything. As I slipped out into the alley, I heard the man\u2019s final warning call after me: \u201cAre you prepared to initiate the next phase of your compliance review?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t look back.
