# =============================================================================
# WORLD LOGIC
# =============================================================================

world_logic:
  imperial_logic: |
    Cyrodiil is the heart of the Septim Empire. Law, trade, and the Emperor's
    peace extend from the Imperial City to the provinces. The Amulet of Kings
    binds the covenant between Emperor and gods. The legions keep the peace.
    Civilization is order; the wilds are chaos.

  history_shape: |
    Alessia's slave rebellion → Reman's empire → Interregnum → Tiber Septim's
    conquest → the Third Era of relative peace. The current Emperor, Uriel VII,
    has ruled for decades. Stability feels eternal but is fragile.

  tone: |
    High fantasy with Roman and medieval European aesthetics. Magic is real and
    regulated. Gods are present and interventionist. Good and evil exist as
    cosmic forces. Violence is common but has weight. Honor matters. Oaths bind.

  technology_level: |
    Medieval with magic augmentation. Steel swords, stone castles, horse travel.
    Alchemy produces potions. Enchantment empowers items. The Mages Guild
    regulates magic. No machinery — all power is labor or magical.

  mortality_rules: |
    Death is real but soul-involved. The afterlife exists — Aetherius for the
    blessed, Oblivion for the damned or those claimed by Daedric princes.
    Violence has social and legal consequences. Murder is a crime. Self-defense
    is recognized. Guards respond. Bounties accrue.
