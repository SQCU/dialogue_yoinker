# Gallia Lore Bible
# France-for-Franceless-World
# A bureaucratic survival RPG

bible_id: gallia
setting_name: "Gallia"
tagline: "Forms in triplicate. Wine with lunch. Violence by appointment."

# =============================================================================
# WORLD LOGIC
# =============================================================================

world_logic:
  terroir_equivalent: |
    Places have essences (terroir) that affect everything produced there —
    wine, cheese, people, ideas, institutions. A person "of" a region carries
    its character. This is not metaphor; it has mechanical weight.
    
  history_shape: |
    Empire, revolution, empire, republic, repeat. Gallia is always restarting.
    The current republic is the Fifth (or Sixth, depending on who you ask).
    Every generation relitigates the Revolution. The past is never settled.
    
  tone: |
    Bureaucratic absurdism. Passionate about abstractions. Violence mediated 
    through procedure. Food is sacred. Regional identity is life-or-death.
    Formal register masks genuine emotion. Cynicism and idealism coexist.
    
  technology_level: |
    Near-future bureaucratic-industrial. The Leclerc tanks exist alongside 
    pneumatic tube message systems and hand-stamped documents. Technology 
    serves procedure, not efficiency. Nothing is fully automated because 
    automation would eliminate jobs.
    
  mortality_rules: |
    Death is real but bureaucratically complicated. A body generates paperwork.
    Violence is costly because it requires forms. Most conflicts are resolved
    through exhaustion, resignation, or transfer to another département.
    When violence happens, it is sudden and final — no one wants the paperwork
    of a wounded enemy.

# GAME MECHANICS — Gallia Specific
# =============================================================================
# These are DIFFERENT from the reference games (FNV/Oblivion/Skyrim)
# to ensure translations don't just reskin combat RPG conventions

game_mechanics:

  # --- PRIMARY STATS (Not Physical Combat) ---
  stats:
    # Instead of Strength/Agility/Intelligence:
    - stat_id: "dossier"
      description: "The thickness and completeness of your official file"
      affects: ["institutional_access", "bureaucratic_leverage", "threat_credibility"]
      note: "High dossier = the system knows you. Good and bad."
      
    - stat_id: "terroir"
      description: "How strongly you're marked by regional origin"
      affects: ["regional_trust", "parisian_suspicion", "dialect_options"]
      note: "High terroir = authentic but provincial. Low = cosmopolitan but rootless."
      
    - stat_id: "patience"
      description: "Tolerance for procedural delay and bureaucratic friction"
      affects: ["queue_endurance", "form_completion", "appeal_success"]
      note: "The primary survival stat. Running out = breakdown or violence."
      
    - stat_id: "connections"
      description: "Who owes you favors, who you owe"
      affects: ["shortcut_access", "information_quality", "debt_burden"]
      note: "A resource that depletes when used. Debts are tracked."
      
    - stat_id: "presentation"
      description: "How correct your documents, dress, and manner are"
      affects: ["first_impressions", "forgery_detection", "formal_register_access"]
      note: "Wrong tie = wrong class = wrong treatment."

  # --- DERIVED STATS ---
  derived:
    - derived_id: "standing"
      formula: "(dossier + connections) / 2"
      description: "Your official position in the social hierarchy"
      
    - derived_id: "suspicion"
      formula: "actions_taken - dossier_justification"
      description: "How much attention you're attracting"
      note: "High suspicion = audits, questions, delays"
      
    - derived_id: "debt_load"
      formula: "sum(outstanding_favors_owed)"
      description: "What you owe to whom"
      note: "Unpayable debt = loss condition for some factions"

  # --- INTERACTION TYPES (Not Combat) ---
  interaction_types:
    - type_id: "queue"
      description: "Waiting for service. Patience depletes. Connections can skip."
      outcomes: ["service_received", "office_closed", "patience_exhausted", "bribe_opportunity"]
      
    - type_id: "form_filing"
      description: "Completing bureaucratic requirements"
      outcomes: ["accepted", "rejected_incomplete", "rejected_suspicious", "lost_in_system"]
      modifiers: ["presentation", "patience", "connections"]
      
    - type_id: "meal"
      description: "Sharing food. Information and favors flow more easily."
      outcomes: ["trust_built", "debt_incurred", "secret_revealed", "alliance_formed"]
      note: "Refusing a meal is a serious insult. Consequences."
      
    - type_id: "inspection"
      description: "Your papers/premises/story being examined"
      outcomes: ["passed", "delayed", "detained", "fine_levied", "dossier_flagged"]
      modifiers: ["presentation", "dossier", "patience"]
      
    - type_id: "negotiation"
      description: "Reaching agreement on terms"
      outcomes: ["deal_struck", "impasse", "favor_owed", "favor_called"]
      note: "Everything is negotiable. Nothing is free."
      
    - type_id: "confrontation"
      description: "When procedure fails. Rare. Costly."
      outcomes: ["submission", "escalation", "violence", "mutual_withdrawal"]
      note: "Violence generates paperwork. Both parties lose standing."

  # --- VIOLENCE MECHANICS (De-emphasized) ---
  violence:
    description: |
      Combat exists but is mechanically punishing. Not morally — procedurally.
      Every violent act creates a paper trail. Bodies require forms. Witnesses
      require silencing or bribing. The Hexagon notices.
      
    costs:
      - "Standing loss (automatic)"
      - "Suspicion increase (significant)"
      - "Debt to whoever cleans up"
      - "Regional reputation hit"
      - "Potential dossier flag (permanent)"
      
    when_unavoidable:
      - "Durendal protocols (military/emergency — pre-authorized violence)"
      - "Terroir defense (protecting regional honor — socially sanctioned)"
      - "Debt collection (final resort — accepted but not approved)"
      
    mechanics: |
      No HP. No damage numbers. Violence is succeed/fail.
      Success = target eliminated, costs incurred.
      Failure = you are eliminated, your dossier closed.
      The question is never "can I win?" but "can I afford to try?"

  # --- FACTION STANDING (Not Simple Rep) ---
  faction_standing:
    description: |
      Standing with factions is not a number. It's a dossier annotation.
      You are "known to be sympathetic," "under observation," "in good standing,"
      "flagged for audit," "transferred to inactive status."
      
    states:
      - "unknown — no dossier entry, clean slate, no access"
      - "observed — they know you exist, watching"
      - "provisional — probationary relationship, must prove yourself"
      - "standing — normal member/ally, access granted"
      - "flagged — something wrong, under scrutiny"
      - "suspended — access revoked, pending review"
      - "liquidated — relationship terminated, cannot be restored"
      
    note: |
      Unlike FNV/Skyrim where you can grind rep back, liquidated is permanent.
      Some factions WILL liquidate you for a single act. Choose carefully.
