# WORLD LOGIC
# =============================================================================

world_logic:
  survival_logic: |
    Skyrim is harsh. The cold kills. The creatures are deadly. The civil war
    makes travel dangerous. But the Nords are hard people, shaped by hard land.
    They worship Talos openly despite the Thalmor ban. They distrust outsiders.
    They die on their feet.

  history_shape: |
    The Nords were the first humans in Tamriel, taught to shout by dragons.
    They conquered, built an empire, then joined Cyrodiil's empire. Now the
    Septim line is dead, the Empire weakened, the Thalmor ascendant. Ulfric
    Stormcloak has killed the High King. Civil war has begun. And the dragons
    have returned.

  tone: |
    Nordic fantasy with Viking aesthetics. Stoic, martial, fatalistic. The
    afterlife (Sovngarde) awaits warriors who die well. Honor is paramount.
    Magic is mistrusted. Cold is a character. Violence solves most problems.

  technology_level: |
    Medieval Nordic with Dwemer ruins providing higher tech relics. Steel
    weapons, fur armor, mead halls. The Dwemer (dwarves) left automatons and
    artifacts, but they're gone. Magic exists but is viewed with suspicion
    outside the College of Winterhold.

  mortality_rules: |
    Death comes easily in Skyrim. Bandits, animals, the cold, the war. But
    death in battle is not feared — it leads to Sovngarde, the Nordic heaven.
    The draugr (undead) guard ancient tombs. Dragons can only be truly killed
    by the Dragonborn absorbing their souls.

# PROPER NOUN CLUSTERS
# =============================================================================

proper_noun_clusters:
  - cluster_name: "empire_stormcloak"
    meaning_note: |
      The civil war's two sides. The Empire seeks to hold Skyrim in the realm;
      Ulfric's Stormcloaks seek independence and the right to worship Talos.
      Neither is purely good or evil. Both have blood on their hands.
    instances:
      - instance: "the Empire"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "Imperial loyalists"
      - instance: "Stormcloaks"

      - instance: "Jarl"
        type: "title"
        usage: "Ruler of a Hold (regional leader)"

  - cluster_name: "thalmor"
    meaning_note: |
      The Aldmeri Dominion's secret police. High elves who believe in elven
      supremacy. They forced the Empire to ban Talos worship. They hunt
      dissidents. They are the true villains, but not the immediate war.
    instances:
      - instance: "Thalmor"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "Aldmeri Dominion agents"
      - instance: "Justiciar"
        type: "role"

      - instance: "the Dominion"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "The elven empire behind the Thalmor"
      - instance: "the White-Gold Concordat"
        type: "treaty"
        usage: "The peace treaty that banned Talos worship"

  - cluster_name: "dragons"
    meaning_note: |
      Ancient beings returning from the dead, led by Alduin the World-Eater.
      Not mere beasts — they are immortal, intelligent, and their language
      is power (the Thu'um). Only the Dragonborn can truly kill them.
    instances:
      - instance: "dragon"
        type: "creature"
        usage: "The returned beasts"
      - instance: "Alduin"
        type: "leader"
        usage: "The World-Eater, chief dragon, prophesied to end the world"
      - instance: "Thu'um"
        type: "power"
        usage: "Dragon shouts, the Voice"
      - instance: "Dovahkiin"
        type: "title"
        usage: "Dragonborn, one who can absorb dragon souls"
      - instance: "Shout"
        type: "ability"
        usage: "Words of power that create magical effects"

  - cluster_name: "talos"
    meaning_note: |
      Talos is Tiber Septim, the man who became a god. Worship is banned by
      the Thalmor but persists in Skyrim. This is not just religion — it's
      Nordic identity. Talos proves a man can ascend to godhood.
    instances:
      - instance: "Talos"
        type: "divine"
        usage: "The ninth divine (banned from worship)"
      - instance: "shrine of Talos"
        type: "object"
        usage: "Hidden places of worship"
      - instance: "by Talos"
        type: "oath"
        usage: "Common Nordic swear (risky if Thalmor hear)"
      - instance: "the Eight"
        type: "divine"
        usage: "What the Thalmor call the Nine (minus Talos)"

  - cluster_name: "gold"
    meaning_note: |
      Septims remain the currency despite the Septim dynasty's end. Gold is
      gold. The economy is simpler than Cyrodiil's — more barter, less finance.
    instances:
      - instance: "gold"
        type: "currency"
        usage: "Standard reference"
      - instance: "septims"
        type: "currency"
        usage: "The coins themselves"

  - cluster_name: "magic_nord"
    meaning_note: |
      Nords distrust magic. The College of Winterhold is isolated, mistrusted,
      blamed for the Great Collapse. Real Nords fight with steel, not spells.
      The Thu'um is different — it's a gift of the gods, not "magic."
    instances:
      - instance: "the College"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "College of Winterhold, mages' haven"
      - instance: "spell"
        type: "ability"
        usage: "Magic (mistrusted)"
      - instance: "Shout"
        type: "ability"
        usage: "Voice power (not magic, different)"
      - instance: "enchanted"
        type: "property"
        usage: "Magic item (accepted if useful)"
