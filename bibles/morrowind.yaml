# =============================================================================
# WORLD LOGIC
# =============================================================================

world_logic:
  alien_logic: |
    Morrowind is NOT a standard fantasy world. The Dunmer (dark elves) have
    culture, religion, and architecture utterly unlike anything in Cyrodiil.
    Giant mushrooms, cliff racers, silt striders. The gods walk among mortals.
    The Tribunal (living gods) rule alongside Great Houses. Nothing is familiar.

  history_shape: |
    Dunmer were Chimer (changed people) who followed the prophet Velothi away
    from the Aldmeri. They became dark-skinned after the Battle of Red Mountain.
    The Tribunal (Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil) drew power from the Heart of
    Lorkhan and have ruled as living gods for millennia. The Nerevarine prophecy
    threatens everything: the reincarnation of Nerevar will break the Tribunal.

  tone: |
    Dreamlike, alien, uncomfortable. This is not a welcoming land. Outlanders
    are resented. The weather is ash and blight. The landscape is volcanic,
    fungal, bizarre. Religion is syncretic and strange — ancestor worship,
    living gods, the Good Daedra. Violence is clan-sanctioned (Morag Tong) or
    outlawed (Dark Brotherhood). Honor operates differently here.

  technology_level: |
    Pre-industrial with Dwemer ruins providing clockwork artifacts. Dunmer
    use chitin, bone, volcanic glass. Transportation is by silt strider
    (giant insects) or boat. Magic is regulated by the Mages Guild (imperial
    import) but the native Telvanni are independent mage-lords.

  mortality_rules: |
    Death is real, but ancestor worship means the dead remain involved.
    Ancestral tombs are sacred. The Dunmer cremate or inter with great
    ceremony. Corpse desecration (necromancy) is the ultimate taboo.
    The Morag Tong conducts legal assassinations via writ. Violence without
    writ is murder.

proper_noun_clusters:
  - cluster_name: "tribunal"
    meaning_note: |
      The three living gods of Morrowind: Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil. They
      drew power from the Heart of Lorkhan after the Battle of Red Mountain.
      They are worshipped in the Tribunal Temple. Their power is waning.

  - cluster_name: "great_houses"
    meaning_note: |
      The five Great Houses control Morrowind through political maneuvering,
      not war. Each has distinct culture and territory. House Hlaalu is
      pro-Imperial. House Redoran is martial. House Telvanni is mage-lords.
      House Indoril is theocratic. House Dres is slavers (not in game).
    instances:
      - instance: "House Hlaalu"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "Merchant house, pro-Imperial, Balmora"
      - instance: "House Redoran"

        type: "faction"
        usage: "The destroyed sixth house, now awakening"

  - cluster_name: "nerevarine"
    meaning_note: |
      The prophesied reincarnation of Lord Indoril Nerevar, who will destroy
      the false Tribunal and drive out the Empire. The Ashlanders (nomadic
      Dunmer) believe in this prophecy. The Temple suppresses it.
    instances:
      - instance: "Nerevarine"
        type: "title"
        usage: "The prophesied reincarnation"
      - instance: "Nerevar"

      - instance: "prophecy"
        type: "concept"
        usage: "The Seven Visions, the stranger's path"

  - cluster_name: "empire_morrowind"
    meaning_note: |
      The Septim Empire occupies Morrowind via treaty, not conquest. The
      Armistice guarantees Dunmer customs (including slavery). The Legion
      maintains order in towns. The Empire is tolerated, not loved.
    instances:
      - instance: "the Empire"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "Imperial occupation"
      - instance: "outlander"

        type: "treaty"
        usage: "Peace treaty preserving Dunmer customs"
      - instance: "Legion"
        type: "military"
        usage: "Imperial soldiers, Fort Moonmoth, etc."

  - cluster_name: "gold_morrowind"
    meaning_note: |
      Currency is drakes (gold coins), same as the Empire. But the Dunmer
      also trade in services, debts, and favors. The slave trade is legal
      here and uses Khajiit and Argonian slaves as currency of sorts.
    instances:
      - instance: "gold"
        type: "currency"
        usage: "Standard"
      - instance: "drakes"
        type: "currency"
        usage: "Coins"
      - instance: "slaves"
        type: "trade_good"
        usage: "Khajiit, Argonians (legal in Morrowind)"

  - cluster_name: "blight"
    meaning_note: |
      The blight storms from Red Mountain carry the influence of Dagoth Ur.
      Corprus disease transforms victims into mindless monsters. The Ghostfence
      contains (barely) the worst of it. This is the setting's creeping doom.
    instances:
      - instance: "blight"
        type: "hazard"
        usage: "Disease-carrying ash storms"
      - instance: "corprus"
        type: "disease"
        usage: "The divine disease, transforms the body"
      - instance: "Ghostfence"
        type: "structure"
        usage: "Magic barrier containing Red Mountain"
      - instance: "Red Mountain"
        type: "place"
        usage: "Volcanic center, Dagoth Ur's stronghold"
      - instance: "Dagoth Ur"
        type: "antagonist"
        usage: "Awakened god beneath the mountain"

  - cluster_name: "morag_tong"
    meaning_note: |
      The Morag Tong is a legal assassin's guild, sanctioned by the Temple.
      They carry writs of execution. A kill with writ is legal. The Dark
      Brotherhood is their illegal competitor, hated and hunted.
    instances:
      - instance: "Morag Tong"
        type: "faction"
        usage: "Legal assassins"
      - instance: "writ"
        type: "document"
        usage: "License to kill a specific person"
      - instance: "honorable execution"
        type: "phrase"
        usage: "A Morag Tong killing"
      - instance: "Dark Brotherhood"

      Reputation is numerical. Disposition is per-NPC. Faction rank requires
