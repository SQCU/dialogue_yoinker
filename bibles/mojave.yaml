# =============================================================================
# WORLD LOGIC
# =============================================================================

world_logic:
  survival_logic: |
    The world ended in nuclear fire. What remains is scarcity, violence, and
    the slow reconstruction of civilization from the ashes. Water is precious.
    Food is uncertain. Medicine is rare. Violence is the default.

  history_shape: |
    Pre-war America → Great War (2077) → chaos → tribalism → new powers rising.
    The NCR represents democratic reconstruction. The Legion represents
    authoritarian order. House represents technological aristocracy.
    All three want the Mojave. Hoover Dam is the prize.

  tone: |
    Retrofuturist Americana. 1950s aesthetics survived nuclear war. Optimism
    is black humor. Violence is common and often unremarked. Everyone has
    lost someone. Survival is not guaranteed. Trust is earned slowly.

  technology_level: |
    Atomic age technology preserved in vaults, scavenged from ruins. Energy
    weapons coexist with pipe rifles. Robots still function. Medicine is
    pre-war stimpaks or wasteland remedies. No new manufacturing — only
    salvage, repair, improvisation.

  mortality_rules: |
    Death is cheap. Most conflicts end in violence. Bodies are common.
    Life expectancy is short. Children grow up fast. The old are rare.
    Violence has few consequences beyond immediate survival. Killing
    raiders is expected. Killing innocents is frowned upon but common.
