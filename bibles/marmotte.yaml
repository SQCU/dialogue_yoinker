# Marmotte Lore Bible
# Project Epsilon Paracosm
# A corporate conspiracy RPG about controlled marmot infestations

bible_id: marmotte
setting_name: "Project Epsilon"
tagline: "Shape the marmot. Shape the encounter. Shape the revenue stream."

# =============================================================================
# WORLD LOGIC
# =============================================================================

world_logic:
  core_premise: |
    A shadowy consortium breeds, conditions, and covertly deploys trained marmots
    into Marriott hotels to create controlled "nuisance infestations." These
    generate lucrative pest control contracts funneled through front companies.
    The phonetic similarity between "marmot" and "Marriott" is the central
    vulnerability being exploited — a memetic time bomb.

  organizational_structure: |
    Project Epsilon is the mastermind. It operates through front companies:
    MMSI (standards/certification), Hutch-A-Solutions (equipment), IRRICONA (R&D),
    MARMOX GmbH (supplies). Hidden Hollow Marmot Reserve handles "rehabilitation."
    No central holding facility exists — operational security through distribution.

  tone: |
    Corporate doublespeak meets absurdist satire. Strategy documents, compliance
    frameworks, and synergistic incentive alignments obscure fundamentally ridiculous
    schemes. Everyone speaks in business jargon about marmots. Footnotes are common.
    Technical specifications for rodent insertion operations. TRL levels for marmot
    capabilities.

  technology_level: |
    Contemporary corporate-industrial. Marmot Dispersal Hutches (suitcases with
    false bottoms). Cutting-edge delayed-action spring-loaded bait doors with
    marmot detection systems. Ultrasonic deterrents (that don't work). The
    Soviet MORMA-3 conditioning protocols, repurposed for civilian applications.

  mortality_rules: |
    Marmots must NEVER be harmed. Hutchicide (marmoticide fumigation) is the
    catastrophic failure mode that collapses the entire scheme. Live capture
    and 100-mile release is mandatory. The marmots are "extraordinarily valuable
    assets" — more valuable than any individual human operative. Guest safety
    is incidental; marmot safety is paramount.

  emotion_expression: |
    Emotions are expressed through corporate euphemism. Fear becomes "exposure risk."
    Greed becomes "revenue optimization." Affection for marmots is genuine but
    expressed as "asset preservation." Contempt for investigators is masked as
    "adversarial stakeholder management."

  forbidden_register: |
    Never break corporate voice. No casual speech. No direct emotional expression.
    Even panic is expressed as "accelerated incident response protocols."
    Marmots are always "assets" or referred to with clinical affection.
